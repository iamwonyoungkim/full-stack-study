### let vs. const

Basically, an identifier with "let" is called a variable, and an identifier with "const" is called a constant. A variable can keep changing its value, whereas a constant cannot change its value once it's set.

### Since it's scalable, isn't a variable better?

Saying something is scalable doesn't necessarily mean it's good in terms of performance; in fact, it can be risky. Therefore, it's better to actively use constants.
